Steps for Presentation Generation:

1. Analyze `markdowncontent.txt` File:
    - Understand the syntax and patterns in the `markdowncontent.txt` file.
    - Ensure  *** is a page separator like as shown in markdowncontent.txt file

        - Ensure charts are relevant to the presentation topic and easy to understand.
    - RevealJs Animations:
        - Use RevealJs markdown to animate slides with transitions like 'Fade', 'Slide', 'Convex', 'Concave', and 'Zoom'.
        - Ensure animations enhance the presentation without distracting from the content.
3. Dynamic Content Generation:
    - Tailor the content to the user's topic, making it engaging and relevant.
