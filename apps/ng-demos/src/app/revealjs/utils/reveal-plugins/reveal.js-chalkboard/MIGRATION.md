# Migration Guide for Reveal.js Chalkboard Plugin Refactoring

This document provides guidance on migrating from the original monolithic `plugin.js` file to the refactored version with utility modules.

## Overview

The Reveal.js Chalkboard plugin has been refactored to improve maintainability and readability. The refactoring involves:

1. Extracting functions from the original `plugin.js` file into separate utility modules
2. Organizing these modules by functionality
3. Updating the main `plugin.js` file to import and use these utilities

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Create the Utils Folder Structure

The refactoring introduces a new `utils` folder with the following files:

- `canvas-utils.js`: Canvas-related utility functions
- `drawing-utils.js`: Drawing-related utility functions
- `storage-utils.js`: Storage-related utility functions
- `event-utils.js`: Event handling utility functions
- `ui-utils.js`: UI-related utility functions
- `config-utils.js`: Configuration-related utility functions
- `index.js`: Exports all utilities
- `README.md`: Documentation for the utils folder

### Step 2: Move Functions to Utility Modules

Functions from the original `plugin.js` file have been moved to their respective utility modules based on their functionality. For example:

- Canvas-related functions like `cloneCanvas`, `getCanvas`, and `setupDrawingCanvas` are moved to `canvas-utils.js`
- Drawing-related functions like `drawWithBoardmarker`, `drawWithChalk`, and `drawRectangle` are moved to `drawing-utils.js`
- And so on...

### Step 3: Update the Main Plugin File

The main `plugin.js` file has been updated to:

1. Import the utility modules
2. Use the imported functions instead of the original inline functions
3. Maintain the same public API for backward compatibility

### Step 4: Testing

After the refactoring, thorough testing should be performed to ensure that the plugin still works as expected. This includes:

1. Testing all features of the plugin
2. Checking for any regressions
3. Verifying that the plugin integrates correctly with Reveal.js

## Benefits of the Refactoring

- **Improved maintainability**: Related functions are grouped together, making it easier to understand and modify the code
- **Better organization**: The codebase is now organized by functionality, making it easier to locate specific parts of the code
- **Easier debugging**: With smaller, focused modules, it's easier to debug issues
- **Better code reuse**: Utility functions can be reused across the codebase
- **Easier to extend**: New features can be added more easily by extending the appropriate utility module

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility with the original plugin. The public API remains the same, so existing code that uses the plugin should continue to work without changes.
